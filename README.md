# image-compression-using-k-means

This repository contains code for image compression using K-means clustering.
The notebook is self-explanatory and contains explanations of all cells written to aid the reader.

The code in the notebook makes use of only numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. Other external libraires have not been used. 
In essence, it is an implementation 'from scratch'.

- Value of chosen K is 4
- Works on a single image with runtime of about 2 minutes
- Image is input using a path to plt.imread
- Allows any input dimensions for an image
